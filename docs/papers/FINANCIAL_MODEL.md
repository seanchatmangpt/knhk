## Implementation Notes

### Tools for Tracking

Use Google Sheets for:
- Monthly revenue tracking
- Project pipeline (deposits vs finals)
- Cost tracking
- Cash flow projections

### Monthly Review

Each month, update:
1. Actual revenue vs projections
2. Actual costs vs budget
3. Projects in progress
4. Pipeline value
5. Adjust Year 2-3 projections based on actuals

### Conservative Assumptions

This model is **conservative**:
- Assumes 50% uptime in sales/delivery (should be higher)
- Does NOT include potential for group projects (2-3x revenue)
- Does NOT include licensing/royalties from open-source
- Does NOT include speaking fees or consulting revenue
- Does NOT factor price increases after Year 1

**Real upside is 30-50% higher than projections.**
