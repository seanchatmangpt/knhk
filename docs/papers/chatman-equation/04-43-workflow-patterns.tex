\section{Complete Enterprise Embodiment: All 43 Workflow Patterns}

\label{sec:43-patterns}

\subsection{Enterprise Control Structure Coverage}

All 43 Van der Aalst workflow patterns are implemented as deterministic operators with cryptographic receipts. This complete pattern coverage means every enterprise control structure is executable at machine speed with verifiable provenance. The enterprise operates as a closed, bounded, verifiable fabric where every decision is measured, every operation is auditable, and every rule is enforced within stated SLOs.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{43 Patterns = Complete Enterprise Control}]
\textbf{Complete Coverage}: All 43 patterns implemented as deterministic operators.

\textbf{Evidence}: Operator registry, conformance tests, OTEL spans.

\textbf{Verification}: Each pattern maps to KNHK operator ID, hook ID, SLO, receipt template, and YAWL reference.

\textbf{Result}: Every enterprise control structure is executable at machine speed with verifiable provenance.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Pattern-to-Operator Mapping}

Table~\ref{tab:patterns} maps all 43 workflow patterns to KNHK operators and hook IDs.

\subsection{Evidence and Verification}

\textbf{Operator Registry}: All 43 patterns are registered in the KNHK operator registry with unique operator IDs, hook IDs, and receipt templates.

\textbf{Conformance Tests}: Each pattern has conformance tests verifying deterministic execution, guard enforcement, and receipt generation.

\textbf{OTEL Spans}: All pattern executions produce OTEL spans with latency measurements, guard activations, and receipt hashes.

\textbf{YAWL Compatibility}: All patterns align 1-to-1 with YAWL realizations; conformance documented in operator registry.

\subsection{Receipt Template}

Every pattern execution produces a receipt $R = (\mathrm{pattern\_id}, \mathrm{operator\_id}, \mathrm{hook\_id}, \mathrm{SLO}, \mathrm{merkleRoot})$ where $\mathrm{pattern\_id}$ is the Van der Aalst pattern ID (1--43), $\mathrm{operator\_id}$ is the KNHK operator ID (e.g., \texttt{op\_sequence}), $\mathrm{hook\_id}$ is the knowledge hook ID (e.g., \texttt{hook\_seq}), $\mathrm{SLO}$ is the service level objective (hot/warm/cold path), and $\mathrm{merkleRoot}$ is the SHA3-256 Merkle root for tamper detection.

\subsection{Complete Enterprise Embodiment}

With all 43 patterns implemented, every enterprise control structure is executable at machine speed with verifiable provenance. There are no discretionary routing paths, no manual approval gates, no advisory layers, and no shadow channels. The enterprise operates as a closed, bounded, verifiable fabric where every decision is measured, every operation is auditable, and every rule is enforced within stated SLOs.
