## II. Outreach Templates (Copy & Customize)

### Email Template 1: Cold Outreach (Research Focus)

```
Subject: Implementing Your [Paper Title] - 4-Week Timeline

Hi [PI First Name],

I came across your paper "[Paper Title]" at [venue] and it caught my attention.

The algorithm/system you described for [specific problem] is exactly the kind of
work I've been focused on turning into production systems quickly.

I specialize in taking published research and delivering working, certified
implementations in 3-4 weeks using automated code generation and formal
verification. Results are production-ready and cryptographically proven correct.

Here's how it typically works:
1. I read your paper thoroughly
2. Work with you to formalize the approach
3. Generate production code (Rust/Python/JavaScript)
4. Test & optimize with guaranteed performance
5. Deliver working system + documentation + training

Recent example: [Your previous project name if you have one], or "My framework
generates code from academic papers while maintaining provable correctness"

Cost is typically $15K-$30K depending on complexity, and takes 3-4 weeks.

Would you be interested in a quick 20-minute call to explore if your work is
a good fit?

[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
[Your Email]
[Optional: Brief bio/website link]
```

### Email Template 2: Cold Outreach (Generic)

```
Subject: Quick Question About Your Research

Hi [PI First Name],

I help researchers implement their published work into production systems.

Specifically, I take algorithms and systems from papers and deliver:
  ✓ Working code (multiple languages)
  ✓ Comprehensive tests (automated)
  ✓ Performance certification (guaranteed)
  ✓ Full documentation + examples

Timeline: 3-4 weeks. Cost: $15K-$30K depending on complexity.

I noticed your lab publishes on [research area]. Would you ever be interested
in turning one of your papers into a working system you could use/commercialize?

If so, I'd love a quick conversation about how this could help.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

### Email Template 3: Warm Introduction Referral

```
Subject: [Mutual Contact] Suggested I Reach Out

Hi [PI First Name],

[Mutual Contact Name] suggested I reach out to you about your research on
[specific topic].

I work with researchers to implement their papers into production systems
quickly and affordably. [Mutual Contact] thought we might be a good fit to
work together.

I've been following your lab's work on [specific research] and think
[specific paper] could be a great candidate for implementation.

Do you have 20 minutes next week to explore if this could work for you?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Email Template 4: Follow-up After No Response

**Wait 7 days after first email, then send:**

```
Subject: [Paper Title] - Following Up

Hi [PI First Name],

I sent an email last week about implementing your "[Paper Title]" research.

Just wanted to check in - are you open to a quick conversation about turning
your work into a production system?

No pressure if it's not the right time or fit. But if you're interested, I'm
happy to chat.

Best,
[Your Name]

---
P.S. I'm based in Pasadena if you're at Caltech or USC - happy to meet
in person if that's easier!
```

### Email Template 5: Final Follow-up Before Giving Up

**Wait 7 more days, then send (this is last outreach):**

```
Subject: One More Try - [Paper Title]

Hi [PI First Name],

Last attempt to reach out - I realize you're probably swamped!

If you ever need someone to implement your research into working code, I'm
here. The offer stands anytime.

Best,
[Your Name]

## III. Discovery Call Script

### Pre-Call Preparation

Before the call, prepare:
```
✓ Read the paper (1-2 hours of focus)
✓ List 3-5 specific questions about implementation
✓ Sketch rough architecture on paper
✓ Prepare 2-minute pitch about your approach
✓ Have calendar ready to propose timeline
✓ Know your three price points ($15K, $30K, $50K)
```

### Discovery Call Script (20 minutes)

**Opening (2 minutes)**

```
"Thanks so much for taking the time. I know you're busy.

Quick context: I help researchers implement their published work into
production systems. I specialize in taking papers and delivering working,
tested, production-ready code in 3-4 weeks.

I read your [paper title] and it's exactly the kind of work that's perfect
for this approach. I wanted to explore if it might be valuable for you.

Sound interesting?"

[Pause for response - should be "yes, tell me more" or "maybe, let's see"]
```

**Understanding Their Situation (5 minutes)**

Ask in this order:
```
1. "When you published [paper title], was there a working implementation?"
   [Listen: If yes, how good? If no, why not?]

2. "Have you thought about turning this into working code others could use?"
   [Listen: Understand their intent - research vs commercialization]

3. "What's the biggest blocker right now? [If they say "no time", "no money
   for dev hire", "too complex to implement"]"
   [Listen: This tells you if they're a fit]

4. "Ideally, how would you want this to work? [Let them describe their
   vision - probably unrealistic, and that's ok]"
   [Listen: Understand their expectation on timeline/budget/scope]

5. "If I could deliver [specific algorithm] working and tested in 4 weeks
   for $[Silver price], would that be valuable?"
   [Listen: This is a soft close, gauge interest]
```

**Solution Positioning (5 minutes)**

```
"Here's how I approach it:

Step 1 - Design: I read your paper thoroughly, ask clarifying questions,
and design a schema/specification. (1 week)

Step 2 - Generate: I use automated code generation tools to create production
code, tests, and documentation. (1 week)

Step 3 - Optimize: I optimize for performance and verify the results are
correct. (1 week)

Step 4 - Delivery: You get working code, tests, docs, and a training session.
(1 week)

Total time: 3-4 weeks. You get:
  - Working implementation
  - Comprehensive tests
  - Full documentation
  - Performance certified (proven ≤8 ticks)
  - Training to understand/customize
  - 30 days of support

I have three tiers depending on scope:

SILVER ($15K): One algorithm, single language, proof-of-concept
GOLD ($30K): Full system, multiple languages, production-ready
PLATINUM ($50K): Full system + marketplace + 6 months support + revenue sharing

Which tier sounds closest to what you need?"
```

**Discovery on Scope (5 minutes)**

Based on their answers, drill deeper:
```
If they lean Silver:
  "So we'd focus on just the core algorithm first? Are you thinking proof
  of concept or usable research tool?"

If they lean Gold:
  "The full system - that means implementing all the algorithms from the
  paper? And you'd want it in multiple languages for your students/collaborators
  to use?"

If they lean Platinum:
  "So you're thinking about this from a commercialization angle? Like
  licensing or spinning this out as a product? I ask because that changes
  how we implement it for durability and scale."
```

**Close (3 minutes)**

```
"So here's what I'm hearing: You need [restate what you heard].

Here's my recommendation: Start with [Silver/Gold/Platinum]. Timeline
would be [timeframe], cost would be [price].

If that sounds right, I'll send you a detailed proposal with:
  - Exact scope (what's in/out)
  - Timeline with milestones
  - Pricing breakdown
  - Process and next steps
  - Contract

You review it, ask questions, and we go from there.

Does that work for you?"

[If yes]:
  "Perfect. I'll send that over tomorrow. You'll have it by [date].
  Any questions come up, just reply to the email."

[If hesitation]:
  "What questions can I answer to help you think about it?"
  [Address specific objections]
```

## V. Objection Handling

### Most Common Objections & Responses

#### Objection 1: "We don't have budget right now"

**Response (Acknowledge + Reframe):**
```
"I completely understand - research budgets are tight. Here's what I'd suggest:

Option 1: Start smaller. Begin with a Silver project ($15K) to prove the
approach works. Once you see the value, you can expand to the full system.

Option 2: Timing. When does your grant renew? Or could you budget for this
in next fiscal year? I'm happy to work with your timeline.

Option 3: If there's no budget at all, could this be part of a graduate
student's research project? That's how many of my clients fund this - as
part of their research pipeline.

Which approach makes sense for you?"
```

#### Objection 2: "This seems expensive for just coding"

**Response (Reframe value):**
```
"I get it. Let me put the ROI in context:

If you hired a developer to do this:
  - $100K/year salary + benefits
  - 6 months for a medium-complexity project = $50K
  - Risk of mediocre results
  - They'd need to learn your research first

What you get with me:
  - $15K-$30K total cost
  - 3-4 weeks delivery
  - Guaranteed quality (certified correct)
  - I understand your research deeply
  - You can use it immediately

So the real comparison is:
  $50K + 6 months for mediocre work
  vs
  $25K + 4 weeks for production-ready code

The ROI is huge, especially if you ever want to publish this, commercialize
it, or integrate it into your research pipeline."
```

#### Objection 3: "Why not just publish code from students?"

**Response (Acknowledge reality):**
```
"Fair question. Student code works for learning, but here's what's missing:

Student code (typical):
  ✓ Gets the algorithm working
  ✗ Minimal documentation
  ✗ Limited tests (maybe none)
  ✗ No performance optimization
  ✗ Hard to maintain or extend
  ✗ Poor error handling
  ✗ Can't be integrated into production
  ✓ Cost: Free (but 3-6 months of time)

Production code (what I deliver):
  ✓ Algorithm working perfectly
  ✓ Comprehensive documentation
  ✓ >90% test coverage
  ✓ Performance optimized (≤8 ticks)
  ✓ Professional error handling
  ✓ Production-ready immediately
  ✓ Can be commercialized
  ✗ Cost: $25K

If you're just using it internally, student code is fine. But if you want
to publish it, have others use it, or commercialize it, you need the
production version.

Which is your use case?"
```

#### Objection 4: "We've already got something running"

**Response (Dig deeper):**
```
"That's great! A few follow-up questions:

1. How production-ready is it? Would you feel confident running it on
   important data or showing it to potential collaborators/partners?

2. Is it documented? Can someone pick it up 6 months from now and understand
   it?

3. How tested is it? What's the test coverage?

4. What language is it in? Would it be useful to have it in other languages?

5. How would you feel about commercializing it - licensing to others?

The reason I ask: most student implementations are great prototypes but
aren't production-ready. If yours is truly production-grade, that's awesome!
But if there are gaps, I can help professionalize it and prepare it for
broader use.

Want to explore that?"
```

#### Objection 5: "I need to check with [someone else]"

**Response (Facilitate the process):**
```
"Of course. Here's what I'd suggest to help move things forward:

Option 1: Let me know who they are, and I'm happy to answer any questions
they have directly.

Option 2: I can prepare a brief overview tailored to their role (e.g., if
it's your graduate student, an overview of how it works; if it's a
collaborator, how it impacts their research).

Option 3: We can schedule a call with both of you so everyone's on the same
page.

What would be most helpful? And what's their timeline for reviewing?"
```

## VII. Closing the Deal

### When They Say "Yes"

```
Email Response:
"That's fantastic! Excited to work with you on this.

Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send you the Service Agreement (attached). Review and let me know
   if you have any questions.

2. Once signed, send me the 50% deposit ($[amount]) to [payment method].

3. Upon deposit clearing, we schedule a kickoff meeting to dive into the
   details.

4. Project officially starts the following week.

Timeline: If we can turn this around in the next few days, we could kick
off next Monday. Does that work?

Let me know if you need anything else!

[Your Name]
```

### When They Ask for Revisions

```
"Great feedback! Let me adjust [X] and send you an updated proposal.

[Adjust proposal based on feedback]

Here's the updated version. Does this address your concerns?"

[Be prepared for 1-2 rounds of revisions, but don't let it drag out.
Set a deadline: "Let me get this back to you by Friday."]
```

### When They Want to Negotiate Price

```
"I appreciate you asking. My pricing is value-based, not negotiable,
because each tier represents a specific value delivery.

However, here's what we can do:

1. Start with a smaller scope (Silver instead of Gold) and expand later
2. Focus on the highest-value components first
3. Extend the timeline slightly (saves you money in my time allocation)
4. Do multiple projects together for slight efficiency gains

What would make the most sense for your situation?"

[Don't discount. Restructure scope instead.]
