## Conclusion

**Vision Statement**:
> By 2030, KNHK completes its 50-year journey—from NASA wind tunnels to autonomous enterprise operating systems. The cycle that took humans months (Plan → Do → Review → Adjust) now runs at machine speed, allowing organizations to encode centuries of methodological rigor as executable, autonomous systems.

**Strategic Positioning**:
- **2028**: Market leader in autonomous workflow systems
- **2030**: De facto standard for enterprise automation
- **2035**: Foundation for autonomous organizations globally

**The Promise**:
> "For 50 years we modeled reality carefully, enforced quality rigorously, and closed feedback loops as fast as our tools allowed. KNHK is those same habits, finally running at hardware speed—autonomously, globally, forever."
