**LEAN Principles:**
- **Stop starting, start finishing** - Complete WIP before starting new work
- **Flow over throughput** - Optimize for completion rate, not start rate
- **Pull over push** - Pull work from Ready when capacity available

**Metrics:**
- Lead Time: Time from Ready → Done
- Cycle Time: Time from In Progress → Done
- WIP Age: Time item has been In Progress
