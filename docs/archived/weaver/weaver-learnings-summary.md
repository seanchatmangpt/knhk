# Weaver Learnings Implementation - Summary

## All Phases Complete ✅

Successfully implemented all four phases of the Weaver learnings plan:

1. ✅ **Phase 1: Policy Engine Integration** - Policy-based validation framework
2. ✅ **Phase 2: Error Diagnostics** - Structured diagnostics with JSON output
3. ✅ **Phase 3: Schema Resolution** - Resolved schema pattern for RDF schemas
4. ✅ **Phase 4: Streaming Processing** - Streaming ingester pattern

## Files Created

- `rust/knhk-validation/src/policy_engine.rs` - Policy engine framework
- `rust/knhk-validation/src/diagnostics.rs` - Structured diagnostics
- `rust/knhk-validation/src/resolved_schema.rs` - Resolved schema pattern
- `rust/knhk-validation/src/streaming.rs` - Streaming ingesters

## Features Added

- Policy-based validation (guard constraints, performance budgets, receipts)
- Structured diagnostics with context and JSON output
- Schema versioning and dependency management
- Streaming ingester trait pattern

## Status

All implementations follow Weaver's architectural patterns while adapting to KNHK's requirements (no_std support, RDF focus, performance constraints).

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
