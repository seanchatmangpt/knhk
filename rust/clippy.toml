# Clippy configuration for KNHK workspace
# Evaluates all warnings and configures appropriate behavior

# Allow some warnings that are acceptable for CLI tools
# These are informational or acceptable patterns

# Allow dead code for infrastructure that's reserved for future use
# This is acceptable for receipt tracking and other future features
# Set via #[allow(dead_code)] on specific items

# Allow unwrap/expect in CLI tools (user-facing errors)
# CLI tools can use unwrap/expect for user-facing errors
# This is already handled per-crate with #![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]

# Performance lints (important for hot path)
# These are critical for performance-sensitive code
# Enable all performance-related lints
[performance]
# Warn about unnecessary clones
unnecessary-clone = "warn"
# Warn about inefficient string operations
inefficient-string-operation = "warn"
# Warn about large enum variants

# Correctness lints (critical for correctness)
[correctness]
# Warn about potential panics
panic = "warn"
# Warn about incorrect implementations
incorrect-impl = "warn"
# Warn about integer arithmetic issues
integer-arithmetic = "warn"

# Style lints (code quality)
[style]
# Warn about unnecessary parentheses

# Warn about unnecessary casts

# Warn about redundant closures

# Complexity lints (code maintainability)

# Warn about overly complex functions

# Warn about too many parameters

# Warn about too many lines
