# Clippy configuration for KNHK workspace
# Evaluates all warnings and configures appropriate behavior

# Note: Clippy doesn't support grouped sections like [performance], [correctness], etc.
# Individual lint names must be specified directly.

# Performance lints (important for hot path)
# These are critical for performance-sensitive code
unnecessary-clone = "warn"
inefficient-string-operation = "warn"
large-enum-variant = "warn"

# Correctness lints (critical for correctness)
panic = "warn"
incorrect-impl = "warn"
integer-arithmetic = "warn"

# Style lints (code quality)
unnecessary-parens = "warn"
unnecessary-cast = "warn"
redundant-closure = "warn"

# Complexity lints (code maintainability)
cognitive-complexity = "warn"
too-many-arguments = "warn"
