# Clippy configuration for knhk-cli
# Evaluates all warnings and configures appropriate behavior

# Allow unwrap/expect in CLI tools (user-facing errors)
# CLI tools can use unwrap/expect for user-facing errors
# This is already handled in main.rs with #![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]

# Allow dead code for infrastructure that's reserved for future use
# This is acceptable for receipt tracking and other future features
# Set via #[allow(dead_code)] on specific items

# These are critical for performance-sensitive code
[performance]
